CSS  
UIkit    
Javascript           

## How to Use      
Navigate to https://alyssahellrung.github.io/lemurfanpage/. The home page gives brief information about lemurs. Click "Species" in the nav bar to learn about six species of lemur. Click "Learn More" to find links to other resources you can use to find out more about lemurs. Click "Conservation" to find links to the websites for lemur conservation organizations.  


## How I Made This    
I built this project with HTML5 and CSS with UIkit. The purpose of the project was initially to practice using UIkit, a library I had never used before. As I got more into the project, the educational value of it became more apparent, and rather than make a silly webpage that didn't really say anything, I turned it into more of an actual educational effort.

## Future Development Ideas     
--I would like to add more user interaction--perhaps users could sign a guest book when they visit, or they could fill out a contact form for a lemur newsletter.
